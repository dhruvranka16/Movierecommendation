Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook files or Python scripts to execute the different recommendation models.

Follow the instructions provided in each notebook or script for generating movie recommendations.

Project Overview
This project includes the following components:

Data Preprocessing: The movie and ratings datasets are cleaned and processed to prepare them for recommendation models.

Content-Based Recommendation: Recommendations are generated based on the content of movies, such as genres and titles.

Collaborative Filtering (K-Nearest Neighbors): User-item interactions are used to make movie recommendations by finding similar users or items.

Genre-Based Recommendation: Recommendations are made by comparing the genre of a selected movie with other movies.

Recommendation Models
Content-Based: Uses movie content to recommend similar movies to the selected one.

KNN Model: Collaborative filtering approach based on user-item interactions.

Genre-Based: Recommends movies with similar genres to the selected movie.

Performance Evaluation
The performance of each recommendation model is evaluated based on the average ratings of recommended movies. The model with the highest average rating is considered the best performing.
